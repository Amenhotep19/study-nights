## What we're doing today

Tonight guest speaker, Emily, will cover the who, what & why of design systems, as well as GitHub's approach to building a React component library to accompany Primer. You will walk away with a deeper knowledge of how to design a public API for components, how theming works, and common pitfalls one might come across when trying to scale a design system across an organization.

[Emily Plummer](https://twitter.com/emplums) is a Design Systems Engineer at GitHub. Emily is currently working on building an open source component library to accompany GitHub's design system, Primer. She's interested in all things, JavaScript, CSS, and the intersection of the two. Emily resides in Portland, Oregon with her wolf pup Avila and enjoys exploring the Cascade mountains when not working away on pixels.
