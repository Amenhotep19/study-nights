## What we're doing today
For people who missed last month:
1. Creating a [`manifest.json` and `index.html`](https://github.com/sajoy/sn-newtab)
2. Unpacking our local app in the browser
3. Brainstorm/plan/start coding your extension!

For people interested in deploying to the Chrome Web Store:
1. Coding your extension
2. Following along with [Chrome's instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to publish (note: there is a $5 dev fee you have to pay as one of the last steps)

## Coding time!
- Anyone interested in pairing up to work on an idea or a bug?
- Around 7:30, we'll go around and share what you worked on! (If you want to.)
