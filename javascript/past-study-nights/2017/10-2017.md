## What we're doing today
We're going to build a graveyard of ghosts using some new fandangled tech: web components!

![ghosts](https://github.com/sajoy/graveyard-friends/blob/master/ghost-components.gif?raw=true)

1. We'll walk through the different parts of the existing `grave-yard` component
    - We can add more custom options: faces! colors! what else?
2. We'll create a new custom component!
    - Candy corn? That on click alerts a corny Halloween joke?

### What is a web component?
>  You can think of Web Components as reusable user interface widgets that are created using open Web technology. They are part of the browser, and so they do not need external libraries like jQuery or Dojo. 

> With a Web Component, you can do almost anything that can be done with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and it can be a portable component that can be re-used easily.
From [MDN Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)

You can think of it like `video`, `audio`, and even `input` HTML elements: they are elements that have built-in styles and behavior.

### Examples
- [hamburger buttons](http://kcmr.github.io/transburger-icon/components/transburger-icon/demo/)
- [progress bar (codepen)](https://codepen.io/ben336/pen/nvfLa?page=12)
- [emoji friend (codepen)](https://codepen.io/norbert989/pen/aWeWKp)

### Steps to create a custom web component
(based largely on the various resources listed below)

1. Create an HTML template (in your HTML)
2. Extend the HTMLElement Class (in your JavaScript)
3. Register the custom element with the document (in your JavaScript)
4. Use your element in your HTML (in your HTML)
5. Do a fancy ghost dance (in real life)

### Ghost starter code
- [graveyard-friends](https://github.com/sajoy/graveyard-friends)
    - Fork/clone the repo
    - If you are unfamiliar with Git/GitHub, you can download the code as a zip instead
