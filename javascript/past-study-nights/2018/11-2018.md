## What we're doing today
1. Virtual meetup! Unconference-style.
    1. Introduce yourself and share what you're working on or a question or interest you have. The more specific the question, the better!
    1. We'll list everyone's questions and interests in a collaborative document and decide as a group what questions or topics we want to study for the night.
    1. We'll individually research a topic for 15 minutes then regroup to discuss the topic, share what we've found, and update our document with links. Or if someone wants to debug something they're working on, they'll share their screen and we'll do that for a set amount of time. Depending on interest, what topics we select, and time, well hopefully get through multiple topics.
