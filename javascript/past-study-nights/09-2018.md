## What we're doing today
1. Code reading: [JavaScript Mouse Trail](https://codepen.io/falldowngoboone/pen/PwzPYv?editors=0010)
    1. Goal: understand how the trail is being made
    1. Goal: figure out ways to refactor and make code easier to read
    1. Goal: add feature that changes the color of the trail depending on where in window the mouse is
    1. Goal: come up with your own question or feature you want to add. What do you need to know?
1. Self-study time
