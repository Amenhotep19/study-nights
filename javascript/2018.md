Hi there! If you're checking out this schedule and are interested in giving a brief talk or leading a workshop around one of these topics, contact [SJ](http://twitter.com/superissarah) ASAP! 

Our goal for 2018 is to offer a place and space for JavaScript developers to level up their understanding of the internet's favorite language. We welcome all levels, but our topics will focus on providing the most value for people who have already established a learning relationship with JavaScript. Absolute beginners are always, always welcome! We'll give you resources and exercises to help you learn JS, as well as the space and opportunity to speak with others learning. The talks and subjects might be out of your comfort zone, but we encourage you to stay and absorb by osmosis (:
