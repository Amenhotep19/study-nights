What is DevOps:

- Development Operations
  . The philosophy and practice of supporting services through their entire lifecycle.

Primary Roles:

- Developer Support
  . Systems Access
  . Service and Capacity Planning
  . Source Control Management (git, svn, etc)

- Systems Administration
  . Secrets & Access Management
  . Configuration Management
    : User Management
    : Package Management
    : Service Configuration
  . Monitoring and Logging
    (Subplot - Pagerduty/Alert Management)
  . Infrastructure Provisioning
    : DNS
    : Network Planning

- Release Management

- Cloud Operations
  . Provisioning
  . Instance Management

- Service Architecture
  . Disaster Recovery
  . Capacity Planning

Secondary Roles:

- Security
  . Reviewing Logs for Anomalies
  . Regularly checking for important security patches
  . Serve as a check against Developers not following best-practices

- Database Management

What we aren't (generally) supposed to be:

- Information Technology
- Client Support
- Backend Development
- On-Call 24x7/365

Concepts and Tools:

  - Developer Support
    . Secure Shell (SSH)
    . Source Control Management (SCM) e.g. git, svn

  - Systems Administration
    . Right Tools for the Right Job
    . Off-the-rack solutions, always
    . Modern solutions, always
    . Server OS
      : Red Hat vs Ubuntu
    . Configuration Management
      : Puppet, Chef, Ansible
    . Core System Services
      : SSHD
      : NTP
      : Upstart/SystemD/SysV
      : Monitoring & Logging Daemons
    . Monitoring and Logging
      : Resolution
      : Retention
      : Distributed Systems
      : Monitoring - customer failure, Nagios, Sensu, 3rd Parties, Cloudwatch
      : Alerting - Cron, Pagerduty, Pingdom
      : Logging - on-disk, rsyslog, ELK, 3rd Parties
    . Infrastructure Provisioning
      : Network Isolation
      : DNS, or "Dude, where's my service?"

  - Release Management
    . The Art of Making Services Run
    . Different Codes, Different Tools
      : Docker - Just About Anything
      : Java - Maven => Jars
      : Python - Pip, PEX (Developed by Twitter)
      : Ruby - Gem, Capistrano
      : Generic - Jenkins, Rundeck, Config Mgmt Tool, Plain Old Git
      : System Packages - Advanced Packaging Tool (DEB), Yellowdog Updater, Modified (RPM)

  - Cloud Operations
    . Provisioning
      : Need what you use, use what you need
    . Instance Management
      : Always Use Source Control Management
      : Ghosts are alive
      : Provisioning Tools - bash scripts, aws-tools, chef/ansible, terraform, cloud formation (AWS)

  - Service Architecture
    . Disaster Recovery
      : Everything Must Break
      : All Services Stand Alone
      : All Eggs in Two Baskets
      : Time to Recovery (TTR)
    . Capacity Planning
      : Ideal Solution + Minimum Viable Solution
      : Regular Check-in for Right Size
      : Kill Everything, Often
