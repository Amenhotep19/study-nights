# One Task Minion

## Problem Statement
You are the Boss!  You have one minion working for you.  The minion cannot handle more than one task at time.  If given a list of tasks, the minion will become demoralized and give up.  Therefore, it is your job, as the Boss, to only give the minion one task at a time.

The minion can complete a single task in 5 seconds (nifty).
However, as the Boss, you are busy, and cannot spend all day waiting for your minion to complete each task before issuing another command.
Therefore you will program a queue to automatically issue the next task to your minion, so that you can go do your real job: being Oprah Winfrey.

## Input
N integer : number of commands
N number of strings ended with newline

## Output
every 5 seconds print next command until queue is empty
